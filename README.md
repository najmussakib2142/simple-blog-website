# SimpleBlog

SimpleBlog is a full-stack blogging platform built with Next.js 16, React 19, MongoDB, and Mongoose, designed to provide a smooth, responsive, and secure writing experience. The platform allows users to create, edit, delete, and manage blog posts with real-time database integration and modern UI components.

The application uses Next.js App Router for routing and server-side functionality, enabling efficient data fetching, fast page transitions, and scalable backend API routes. MongoDB serves as the primary database for storing post content, metadata, and user information, while Firebase Authentication ensures secure user access.

The UI is fully responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, combined with smooth animations from Framer Motion and crisp icons from Lucide React. The project follows a modular folder structure, making the codebase clean, maintainable, and production-ready.
